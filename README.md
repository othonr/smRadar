## To install: 
```
Just clone or download this repository
Replace the files in your Scrap Mechanic instalation directory
(BackUp your original ones first, obviously)
```

##### Chat commands:

- `/map zero` : Will home the radar to where you are standing
- `/map compass` : Toggles the compass
- `/map angle` : Toggles the angle to home
- `/map distance` : Toggles the distance to home
- `/map position` : Toggles the position of the character
- `/map cell` : Toggles the current cell the player is at
- `/map crash` : Homes the crash site
- `/map master zero` : Will home all players to current position

I am planing on making a better interface with graphical elements, but i'm having a bit of trouble with it, since i'm confident in python but the game comes in lua, if you want to help me with that send me an email.
