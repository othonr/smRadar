# Scrap Mechanic Simple Radar
#### Since the devs haven't added this feature yet, i made my own...
This adds a very simple radar interface to the survival version of the game

The Radar:

## To install: 
```
Just clone or download this repository
Replace the files in your Scrap Mechanic instalation directory
(BackUp your original ones first, obviously)
```

To use type in the chat:

`/map home` : Will zero the radar to where you are standing, otherwise it will use the crash site as home

I am planing on making a better interface with graphical elements, but i'm having a bit of trouble with it, since i'm confident in python but the game comes in lua, if you want to help me with that send me an email.
